        I would like to narrate the story of every fresher candidate and their
        struggles, using the example of the film industry. Freshers are like a person 
        who wants to become a director (employee), Interns are like assistant 
        directors, HRs are like producers, Companies are like production houses, 
        and Skills are like the story.
        A person (student) graduates from film school (Institutions and 
        Universities) having learned skills in filmmaking (skills deployment) for the 
        film field (IT field). Tutors teach how to make a sci-fi movie 
        (specialization). After graduating from film school, the person wants to 
        become a director (employee). So, he writes some stories (projects) and 
        chooses one story like "Interstellar" (major project) that he wants to narrate 
        (showcase) to the production houses (companies) to seek a chance to work 
        with them. He applies to many production houses (companies); some houses 
        give dates for the narration (interview), while others do not give 
        opportunities to freshers. By God's grace, even though the person gets a 
        chance from a production house, after the narration, the production house is 
        looking for certain scripts (skills) like fantasy, drama, adventure, and thriller, 
        for example, "500 Days of Summer" which the person is poor at. They 
        eventually reject the person because their scripts (skills) do not match their 
        requirements. Some producers from the houses ask the person, "Do you have 
        any experience as a director (employee) or A.D. (intern) in the past?" As a 
        fresher, the person doesn’t have any experience as an A.D. either. So, the 
        producer suggests him to become an A.D. first. The openings for A.D.s 
        (interns) and directors (employees) are very low because of the low market 
        (recession) period. Family members and senior film-related staff (senior 
        employees) suggest him to take some film courses (coaching) and try 
        continuously. The worst part is some of the senior filmmakers (senior 
        employees) don’t even give suggestions (guidance). As time passes, society 
        starts portraying the person as a loser compared to other directors 
        (employees). There is no value for your scripts (skills) unless you become a 
        director (employee).
        But don’t lose hope, guys. I strongly believe this is just a phase that every 
        graduate faces. The race track is waiting for us; tie your shoelaces tightly 
        before you enter. Be a positive-minded person, and that will be one of the 
        bricks to your success
